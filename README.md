# Quilted Resume™ _v0.1.2_

A spec for a minimal, iconographed resume = beautiful 



## Purpose

Recruiters look at a lot of resumes. Interviewers do not have time to look at your resume before the interview starts. There are too many resume formats.


A resume should be like a fine dining menu. A description of a menu item should invite conversation with the waiter. Likewise a resume should invite conversation with the interviewee.


It should be easy to visually parse content and sections. It should have a nice font and clean formatting. It should only contain everything that is necessary and nothing more. It should be tailored to the specific job.


Quilted™ is an opinionated spec for a minimal, iconographed resume which makes it beautiful. Quilted™ aims to eliminate the often over content and complicated formatting of resumes by adhering to a single, minimal spec. Quilted™ uses modern iconography to reduce verbosity.

## Sections

A Quilted resume should flow. Sections should be sorted in the order of importance and necessity.


The heading should always be the first section. Reason being—your resume needs to have an easy identifier i.e. your name and flair.


All content sections are optional. The content sections should be ordered by relevance to the job. All content sections should all use the same font. Each content section should be left iconographed.

Complex sections require a label in a larger font. Compact sections should omit the label. Compact sections are at most 1 line.


Contacts should be the last section. Reason being—only after viewing your resume, your contact info is needed. Contact section should be at most 1 line.




## Heading section

The heading section has two types: a compact version and a complex version.

The compact version holds at most 3 items and is center aligned. It occupies at most 2 lines. The complex version holds at most 5 items and is block justified. It occupies at most 3 lines.

The font should be gray. It should be positioned to the right of your name.


#### Location (recommended)

Location should be where you are seeking a job. It is not your home address. Location should only be a major metro area. The major metro area means you are seeking a position within the proper metro area. It should also have your intended form of travel as an icon.

It should be at most a sentence long. Left aligned and used only in complex heading format. Font color should be black and same size as main content.
